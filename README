qrbrowse opens a text file (either read via stdin or filename
passed via command-line) in a text browser, replacing certain
patterns (like URLs or numbers) to links to QR codes.

I use this in mutt with this muttrc entry:

macro pager <F2> '<enter-command>set pipe_decode=yes<enter>\
<enter-command>set wait_key=no<enter>\
<pipe-message>qrbrowse<enter>\
<enter-command>set wait_key=yes<enter>\
<enter-command>set pipe_decode=no<enter>' \
"View message with QR codes"

This way, when I receive an e-mail with a tracking number or
URL which I want to read on my phone I just hit F2 in the pager,
select the text to be shown as QR code and scan it with my phone.

This is just a simple hack that I release under the MIT license
without any warranty or whatever, just thought it might be
useful to others.
